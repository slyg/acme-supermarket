# ACME Supermarket

Create a solution for the ACME Supermarket problem.

## Description of the problem

ACME's quest for global domination has prompted us to open a supermarket â€“ we sell only three products:

    Product code        Name            Price

    FR1                 Fruit tea       Â£ 3.11
    SR1                 Strawberries    Â£ 5.00
    CF1                 Coffee          Â£11.23

Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and of fruit tea. He wants us to add a rule to do this.

The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a priceâ€¨discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to Â£4.50.
Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO changeâ€¨their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.

The interface to our basket looks like this (shown in JavaScript):

    var basket = new Basket(pricingRules)
    basket.add(item)
    basket.add(item)
    var price = basket.total()

Implement a basket system that fulfills these requirements in JavaScript.

Test Data:

    Basket: FR1, SR1, FR1, CF1
    Total price expected: Â£19.34

    Basket: FR1, FR1
    Total price expected: Â£3.11

    Basket: SR1, SR1, FR1, SR1
    Total price expected: Â£16.61

## Comments about the solution

### Typescript

I chose to use typescript as it is fairly used now and helps shape much better codebases. And as a side effect it provides IDE documentation, should this class be used in a real project... just kidding :)

### Basket class

The `Basket` class is rather simple and relies on the pricing computation rules to return the total price. I chose to extract all computation out of the class (event the basic sum), as it is simply an api and may not be expected to do more than being a naive interface.

Also, the computation of the total price is performed only when the `total()` method is called. It mimics a sort of lazy approach, even though in this case it doesn't really make a difference.

### Pricing rules

We discussed a lot about redux during the phone call, so I thought it would be consistant to use a functional approach _a la_ redux.

So all these rules look like redux reducers on purpose: each of them computes a part of the total amount, which may be a negative number in the case of a discount.

The `Basket` class reduces these amounts to a single one.

To a certain extent, this structure may ease the addition of new pricing rules.

### Tests

Pricing rules are unit tested as well as the `Basket` class.

You'll find a `bdd.spec.ts` file containing the tests corresponding to the problem description.

### Running the code

By convention, you may install the dependencies and run the tests as following:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm test -- --verbose #Â I'm sure you want to see the tests descriptions ðŸ‘€
```

### Other consideration

JS may not be the best suited language to compute numbers: I'd consider using a library like `bignumber.js`, or even delegating the computation to a server.
